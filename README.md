# Cyrus-Beck
Clipping Algorithm using parametric equation of a line.

#Calculate D which is the differences of parametrics P(1) and P(0)
def D(x_0,y_0,x_1,y_1):


#Specifies the directional matrices of left, top, right, bottom sequentially 
  #Then takes the directional matrices and dot products with the D value compiled just above
    #Stores the final matrices in a list ND  
def NiD(func):


#Calculates t values which specifies the point that intersects on the line segments
 based on the clipping window being close or far off 
def calculateT(i):


#This is the function that calculates the parametric function of each line segment after computing
  the t value and attaining the initial value, along with the D value  
def P(x_0, y_0, t, func):


#This is the cyrus-beck algo that accumulates all the other functions
def cyrusBeck(x_0,y_0,x_1,y_1)


#boundary to specify
x_min, y_min | x_max, y_max 


#points to specify
x_0, y_0 | x_1, y_1

#Main function call
